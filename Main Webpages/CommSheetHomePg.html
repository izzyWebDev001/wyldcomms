        <p><em>Digital and Traditional Artist</em></p>
        <p>I am an aspiring artist working towards getting a degree in 2D animation and character design.
        I work with both traditional and digital media, although I tend to favour the latter over the former.
        My commission prices are listed below, along with their current status. For art trades,
        keep updated on their status by frequently checking my social media profiles for updates.
        I can be contacted via email, twitter, instagram, deviantart, and discord (look below for contact info).
        Please read the terms of sevice <em>before</em> contacting me about commissions.</p></td>
